INTRO\
darkness, covers the moor\
(do you) feel it, the oncoming storm\
(hear my) fathers, cry from the grave\
(no longer) will you, rule us as slaves

VERSE\
we cannot forget\
nor will we let you rest\
your guilt a brand that burns\
a sin, that's, without, a, defense

you knew they were, innocent\
you brought death-as-they-slept\
it's your turn to tread the path\
(to the) waiting gates of death

CHORUS\
ever higher, faster \
growing stronger as we \
rise up now to meet the night

stand we here together\
ever getting better\
never giving up the fight

VERSE\
princes will be overthrown\
left rotting in the sun\
tonight you'll sleep alone\
though you think, that, you've al, rea, dy won

**pls write a second half of this verse thanks bby**

CHORUS\
ever higher, faster \
growing stronger as we \
rise up now to meet the dawn

stand we here together\
ever getting better\
never losing who we are

BRIDGE\
**death** comes to **watch** us and he will **not** go home empty **han**ded\
there's a **calm**ness that **comes** when you've **no**thing else to **lose**\
the **sky** stretches exuberant a**bove** me, the earth ex**pan**sive below my **feet**\
**[]** here I **stand**, my **fate** entwined with **yours**\
the **wraiths** of our **fa**thers wind **close**ly be**hind**\
if I **fall** today I do not **fall** alone, we- die- (forever?) free-

POST-BRIDGE CHORUS\
children, now sleep\
without fear because of us\
never, again

six feet, under\
you can't hide away the sun\
never, again

POST-BRIDGE VERSE\
melt your sword for me\
your empty quiver fill with flowers of the field\
we have no need in this new world

watch the vines tear down\
the castle of our nightmares\
we are alive in this new world

POST-BRIDGE CHORUS\
kingdoms, now sleep\
without fear because of us\
never, again

twelve feet, under\
you can't hide away the sun\
never, again
